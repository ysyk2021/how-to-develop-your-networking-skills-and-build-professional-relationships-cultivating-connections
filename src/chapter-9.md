1. Stay in touch: One of the easiest ways to maintain professional relationships is to stay in touch. Schedule regular check-ins with your contacts, whether it's through email, phone calls, or in-person meetings. Ask about their work, share updates on your own projects, and offer support when needed.

2. Show appreciation: Expressing gratitude can go a long way in maintaining professional relationships. Send thank-you notes or small gifts to show your appreciation for their help or advice. Celebrate their successes and milestones, and be there for them during challenging times.

3. Share resources: Sharing resources can be a great way to nurture professional relationships. If you come across an article or event that you think might interest one of your contacts, send it their way. Offer introductions to other professionals in your network who might be able to help them achieve their goals.

4. Attend events: Attending industry events and conferences can be a great way to build community and nurture professional relationships. Make an effort to attend events where you can connect with colleagues, clients, and mentors. Be sure to follow up with new contacts after the event to keep the connection alive.

5. Give back: Giving back to your community can also be a way to maintain professional relationships. Volunteer for industry organizations or participate in mentorship programs. By giving back, you can strengthen your ties to the community and demonstrate your commitment to your profession.
