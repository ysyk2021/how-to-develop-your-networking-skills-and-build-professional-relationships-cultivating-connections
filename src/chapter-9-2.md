Maintaining professional relationships, nurturing connections, and building community are all essential components of successful networking. In this chapter, we will explore strategies for accomplishing these goals.

Strategies for Maintaining Professional Relationships
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Schedule regular check-ins: Make it a priority to schedule regular check-ins with your contacts. This could be in the form of a monthly phone call, a quarterly meeting, or even just an email exchange. By staying in touch, you can keep your connection strong and stay up-to-date on each other's work.

2. Keep your promises: If you promise to do something for one of your contacts, make sure you follow through. Whether it's making an introduction, providing feedback, or offering support, keeping your promises shows that you value the relationship and are committed to helping each other succeed.

3. Show appreciation: Expressing gratitude is an effective way to maintain professional relationships. Take the time to thank your contacts for their help, advice, or support. Whether it's a handwritten note, a small gift, or a verbal expression of thanks, showing appreciation demonstrates that you value the relationship.

Strategies for Nurturing Connections
------------------------------------

1. Be proactive: Don't wait for your contacts to reach out to you. Take the initiative to nurture your connections by sharing updates on your work, sending interesting articles or resources, or inviting them to events or meetings.

2. Seek out opportunities to connect: Look for opportunities to connect with your contacts outside of work-related interactions. For example, you could invite them to join you for lunch, attend a social event together, or participate in a volunteer activity.

3. Focus on building rapport: When nurturing your connections, focus on building rapport rather than just talking about work. Find common interests, share personal stories, and show genuine interest in your contact's life outside of work. By building a personal connection, you can strengthen the professional relationship.

Strategies for Building Community
---------------------------------

1. Attend industry events: Industry events such as conferences, seminars, and workshops are great opportunities to build community. Take advantage of these events by attending sessions, participating in networking activities, and connecting with other attendees.

2. Participate in online communities: In addition to in-person events, there are many online communities where you can connect with other professionals in your field. Join LinkedIn groups or participate in online forums to share knowledge, ask questions, and build relationships.

3. Volunteer for industry organizations: Volunteering for industry organizations is a great way to give back to your community while also building connections. Look for opportunities to serve on committees, organize events, or participate in mentorship programs.

In conclusion, maintaining and nurturing professional relationships and building a strong community are essential for success in any industry. By following the strategies outlined in this chapter, you can maintain your existing connections, nurture new ones, and build a strong network of professionals around you.
